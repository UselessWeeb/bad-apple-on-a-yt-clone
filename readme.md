Let's just say that this is my takes on the bad apple played on youtube because ehhhh,
First,it's not really a youtube.html.The files I tried has been blocked so it's just a clone of the original youtube.html

To use this,you should linked the script inside the script folder onto the html file,or just typing it in the console on dev mode
Idk why,but the output really laggy on normal Egde but fine on VS Code Edge
